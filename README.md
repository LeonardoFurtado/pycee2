# Pycee 2 (WIP)
This is a refactored version of [pycee])(https://github.com/EmillieT/Pycee).
Pycee 2 is a tool that provides enhanced error messages for Python code.


# Installation
```console
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Creating a virtual environment is optional but recommended.

# Testing
From the project root, it's as simple as this:
```console
pytest
```

# Usage
For now, to use Pycee get some traceback of an error you have and put it in ``example_error_message.txt``
and the code that generates the error in ``example_code.py``.
For ease of use there's already an example provided.
Then to execute pycee, from the project root: ``python3 usage.py``.
